# node-apirest
My very first NodeJS web server. It is created with the Express and Sequelize frameworks, connected to a MySQL instance and uses Jest to run tests.


Run npm install

Open MySQL Workbench and create a local instance. Connect the host IP in src/api-server/config/config.js.

For running local, run npx nodemon index.js

For tests, go to the tests folder and run npm test
